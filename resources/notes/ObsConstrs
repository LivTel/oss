Database Table Design
---------------------

CREATE TABLE `OBSERVING_CONSTRAINT` (
  `id` int NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `gid` int default NULL,            /** group id **/
  `type` tinyint default NULL,       /** from ngat.phase2.impl.mysql.reference.ObservingConstraintTypes **/
  `category` tinyint default NULL,   /** category value, e.g Good, Average, Photometric, Civil Twilight etc **/
  `min` double default NULL,
  `max` double default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`));

TODO: LIST CATEGORY VALUE LOCATIONS, AND STANDARDISE.


Seeing
------
4 Categories: Good, Average, Poor, Unconstrained
Need to hook scheduler into these.

(category field)


Extinction
----------
Unit is magnitude.
Two categories: Photometric and Non-photometric.
If Non-photometric offer mag's of extinction.

(category, max fields)


Airmass
-------
Elevation, number in the range 1 to 3 (double)
Default to 2.

(max field)


Hour Angle
----------
Two degree ranges: Before Transit (-12 to 0) degrees, and After Transit (0 to +12) degrees
Measure is > HH:MM:SS
Default to -12:00:00 and +12:00:00

(min, max fields)

Solar Elevation
---------------
Measured in degrees (of Sun below horizon).
Categories as follows:
	00 - 06 Civil Twilight
	06 - 12 Nautical Twilight
	12 - 18 Astronomical Twilight
	18	Night time 

(category field)


Sky Brightness
--------------
Two categories: Dark or Bright
If proposal account is allocated Dark, user can pick: Dark and hence set Lunar Constraints
Otherwise, Bright is only available choice and Lunar Constraints are not available for editing.

(category field)


Lunar Distance
--------------
Only available with Sky Brightness constraint set to Dark.
Measured in degrees 0 - 180 (DDD)
     
(min field)


Lunar Phase
-----------
Only available with Sky Brightness constraint set to Dark.
Number between 0 and 1 (0.NN)

(max field)


Lunar Elevation - RE-DISCUSS, THIS IS SKY BRIGHTNESS REALLY
---------------
Only available with Sky Brightness constraint set to Dark.
Measured in degrees -90 to +90 (SDD)

(max field)


Other ideas:
------------
Need to display Proposal accounting info on the GUI, also how that time is altered according to user alterations.
If committed > allocated for Dark Time, then display in Red, etc.
